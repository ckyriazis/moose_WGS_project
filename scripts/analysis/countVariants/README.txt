These scripts are for counting the number of alleles/genotypes in a given vcf

count_variants.py is for counting the number of homRef, homAlt, and het genotypes in a sample in a vcf, ignoring sites that are fixed across the sample

count_syn.py is for counting the number of synonymous derived alleles per individual in a vcf, also ignoring sites that are fixed across the sample

count_called_geno.py is for counting the total number of called genotypes in a vcf
