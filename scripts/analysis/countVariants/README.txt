These scripts are for counting the number of alleles/genotypes in a given vcf

step 1: subset vcf to coding regions and annotations using get_coding_regions.sh

from there, can use either run_count_alleles.sh or run_count_genotypes.sh to count alleles/genotypes for a given annotation (or the entire coding region)
